# Music Discord Bot
YouTube has been battling discord bots for a long time and most of them are no longer operational. And the other half is wrong in my opinion.
So I decided to create my own bot. He will play songs that will be given to him, and not that he will draw songs himself as it is in other bots.

### Features (More features to come)
- "/play" Plays songs from the given link
- "/stop" Stops the currently playing music
- "/skip" Plays the next song in the list

### Requirement:
- Ffmpeg
- Python

### Bugs:
1.Rarely, however, when listening to or launching a song, such a notification occurs and the song is not played
- discord.player ffmpeg process 12268 successfully terminated with return code of 1.
