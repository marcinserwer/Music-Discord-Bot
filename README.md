# Music Discord Bot
YouTube has been battling discord bots for a long time and most of them are no longer operational. And the other half is wrong in my opinion.
So I decided to create my own bot. He will play songs that will be given to him, and not that he will draw songs himself as it is in other bots.

### Features (More features to come)
- "/play" Plays songs from the given link
- "/stop" Stops the currently playing music

### Requirement:
- Ffmpeg
- Python
